# My Projects:

### Olsen's Packaging - https://olsenspkg.com

_This is a website I made for a packaging company. It consists of 67 pages. I started with a template from Themeforest, but I only used the body structure on 4 pages. I had to heavily customize and modify the body content to fit the company's needs. I also created a parts database for them and a javascript function to search through the parts database. My custom search I built can be found under the parts tab in the nav bar on the page of search our parts._
