# a list of my projects included:

Olsen's Packaging - https://olsenspkg.com

    -- This is a website I made for a packaging company. It consists of 67 pages. I started with a template from Themeforest, but I only used the body structure on 4 pages. I had to heavily customize and modify the body content to fit the company's needs. I also created a parts database for them and a javascript function to search through the parts database. My custom search I built can be found under the parts tab in the nav bar on the page of search our parts.

Got Alchohol? (Group Project) - https://d-taylor6403.github.io/Project1

    -- This project takes in an ingredient, or a specific alcoholic drink, and spits out written instructions on how to make that drink, and also gives you the option to see instructional videos as well. Also there is a create random drink button.

Liri Node App - https://github.com/austindickey/liri-node-app

    -- This is a text based driven app that allows a user to get information about a particular song, a movie, or see the next 5 concerts for a music artist or a band.

Bamazon (Inventory Management App) - https://github.com/austindickey/bamazon

    -- This is a node inventory app that runs in the console.

Sports Trivia Game - https://austindickey.github.io/TriviaGame

    -- This is a trivia game of 20 sports questions set to run on timers. There is a restart button at the end of the game if you would like.

Word Guess Game - https://austindickey.github.io/Word-Guess-Game

    -- This is a simplified version of hangman. Guess the correct letters before you run out of guesses in order to win.

Giphy Widget - https://austindickey.github.io/giphy-widget

    -- This is a simple website that allows you to add a button, and show the top 10 gifs related to that button. The theme is animals, but it honestly works for anything under the sun.

Crystal Collector - https://austindickey.github.io/unit-4-game

    -- This is a game set up on random numbers. You keep clicking until you hit the number goal exactly. Nothing below or above.

Rock Paper Scissors - https://austindickey.github.io/rps-multiplayer

    -- This was originally meant to be a multiplayer game, but I have not been able to figure out the multiplayer aspect just yet. I code it up to play against the computer, but I will keep trying to figure out the multiplayer for now.
